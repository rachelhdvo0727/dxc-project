          <p>The internet of things (IoT) connects physical
            machines and equipment in a factory to the digital world of cloud, data
            analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It enables you to collect
            more data, analyze the information quickly and make better business
            decisions.</p><br>
          <p>Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they
            need to bring IT closer to operational technologies that control
            machines and equipment. Traditionally, these technologies were managed
            by separate departments in relative isolation. Leaders, such as food and
            beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a single integrated
            technology function to leverage synergies.</p>

          <p>The next step is to harness technology to optimize the business and
            drive innovation. Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the
            standard for creating the smart factory and supply chain of the future
            using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics, cloud computing and cyber physical
            systems.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Manufacturers can now consider business model innovation and new
            revenue streams as they leverage the deluge of IoT data. This is often
            called the servitization of the industry. The importance of Industry 4.0
            and the IIoT is well understood, but how do you start implementing these
            concepts to maximize your chances of creating real value?</p>

        <p>Early discussions about IIoT primarily focused on the technology and what it could
          do, rather than on the business value IIoT could deliver. This is not surprising; IoT
          technologies’ cool factor has clearly captured people’s attention. More recently, the
          conversations have shifted to the variety of business benefits IIoT can deliver.</p>

          Some organizations have set up digital innovation labs without clear
          strategic direction or technology roadmaps, and the result is often
          proofs of concept that don’t have value for the business or are not
          supported by their technology functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For IIoT to have a positive impact on the organization, it needs to be
          aligned with the overall business and technology strategy. The
          business strategy provides guidance on goals and objectives, while the
          technology strategy identifies constraints around technology choices.
          The best way to ensure strategic alignment is to create an IoT
          strategy that considers current strategies and also drives changes to
          those strategies. For example, if IIoT provides a new way to ensure
          the health and safety of factory workers, the human resources strategy
          should consider this. Strategic alignment is key, but it is not a
          one-way street.

          The discussion around IIoT is dominated by data analytics, machine
          learning and AI. Business processes may not be the most exciting
          topic, but they are still the core of any organization and define how
          the business operating model is structured. An emerging focus in the
          manufacturing industry is the integration of IIoT solutions into
          business processes. In an IoT report, McKinsey notes that the missing
          integration of IoT solutions into existing business workflows is a top
          IoT capability gap.1
        </p>
        <p>
          IIoT software vendors may claim their products integrate with business
          systems, but simply passing data to a business system is not the same
          as creating an end-to-end business process. Using that process,
          organizations will have an increased number of smart things in their
          factory, increased levels of automation and more complex supply
          chains. The expectation is to make everything work together
          effectively in a way that is dramatically better than today.

          Many IoT industry participants talk about the convergence of IT and
          operational technology, meaning that the management of business
          systems and factory automation technologies will converge. IT and
          operational technology convergence does not only mean a convergence of
          technologies, but also that you can optimize collaboration between
          your office floor and your factory floor. In many cases, this will
          lead to changes in the business operating model and will require new
          capabilities in your organization to manage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another aspect is the creation of value networks, which are
          purpose-built partner ecosystems with the customer in the middle. ETH
          Zurich and Bosch SI developed the concept of an “IoT Business Model
          Builder” that describes how the idea of business model innovation as
          part of Industry 4.0 can be implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of value networks leads to an extended enterprise and is
          necessary because end-to-end IIoT solutions are even more complex than
          separate IT and operational technology solutions were in the past, and
          require a very close collaboration between the value network
          stakeholders.

          With changes to the technology landscape and operating model, employees need to
          learn new skills as their roles change. It is important that people understand IIoT and
          Industry 4.0 concepts from both a business and technology perspective, establishing
          a common language to minimize the risk of misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next level of detailed understanding of IIoT, focused programs that advance
          employees’ capabilities need to be developed. In these programs, active participation
          of the partner ecosystem, or value network, should be considered. A common
          learning experience can improve and drive day-to-day collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider how educational and training programs can affect certain roles in a
          manufacturing company and close skills gaps. Chief operating officers can get
          new insights into the operation of the business, but they will want to understand
          what the new data is and how to incorporate it into their decision making. Chief
          technology officers will be flooded with new technologies and will want to select the
          ones relevant for the business. They will want to learn about functionalities provided
          by IIoT gateways, low-power WAN, sensor boards and IoT platforms. Maintenance
          technicians will want to understand why predictive maintenance is important, and
          how IIoT and data analytics will enable them to be more proactive with maintenance
          inspection activities.

          Vulnerabilities in self-driving cars get a lot of media attention and illustrate the
          security concerns around IIoT. Smart factories are also at risk, and although
          technology vendors are quick to provide security patches, the risks show that security
          is often not built into the design of a production system. One of the reasons is that
          those solutions were closed systems for decades and relatively safe from intruders.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, manipulating machines in a factory typically required physical access
          to the facility, but by linking assets to the internet and deploying IIoT capabilities,
          facilities are now exposed to new security risks. New approaches for cyber-physical
          systems are being developed that include authentication and encryption capabilities
          built into hardware, real-time analytics of network traffic, and IIoT gateways that
          serve as protective shields for factory equipment, similar to the way firewalls perform
          in IT networks. With the convergence of IT and operational technology, “security by
          design” is becoming a key decision criterion as companies choose technologies.
