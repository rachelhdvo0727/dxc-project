        <div class="col1"> <p>The internet of things (IoT) connects physical
        machines and equipment in a factory to the digital world of cloud, data
        analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). It enables you to collect
        more data, analyze the information quickly and make better business
        decisions.</p><br><p>Forward-thinking manufacturers already know they
        need to bring IT closer to operational technologies that control
        machines and equipment. Traditionally, these technologies were managed
        by separate departments in relative isolation. Leaders, such as food and
        beverage giant Lion, have merged the teams to create a single integrated
        technology function to leverage synergies.</p>

       <div class="col2">
      <p>The next step is to harness technology to optimize the business and
      drive innovation. Industry 4.0 advances in manufacturing are setting the
      standard for creating the smart factory and supply chain of the future
      using industrial IoT (IIoT), analytics, cloud computing and cyber physical
      systems.</p>
      <br><p>Manufacturers can now consider business model innovation and new
      revenue streams as they leverage the deluge of IoT data. This is often
      called the servitization of the industry. The importance of Industry 4.0
      and the IIoT is well understood, but how do you start implementing these
      concepts to maximize your chances of creating real value?</p></div>

        <p>There are six critical success factors organizations need to
          consider to successfully use IIoT in their digital transformation
