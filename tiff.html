          Some organizations have set up digital innovation labs without clear
          strategic direction or technology roadmaps, and the result is often
          proofs of concept that donâ€™t have value for the business or are not
          supported by their technology functions.

          For IIoT to have a positive impact on the organization, it needs to be
          aligned with the overall business and technology strategy. The
          business strategy provides guidance on goals and objectives, while the
          technology strategy identifies constraints around technology choices.
          The best way to ensure strategic alignment is to create an IoT
          strategy that considers current strategies and also drives changes to
          those strategies. For example, if IIoT provides a new way to ensure
          the health and safety of factory workers, the human resources strategy
          should consider this. Strategic alignment is key, but it is not a
          one-way street.

          The discussion around IIoT is dominated by data analytics, machine
          learning and AI. Business processes may not be the most exciting
          topic, but they are still the core of any organization and define how
          the business operating model is structured. An emerging focus in the
          manufacturing industry is the integration of IIoT solutions into
          business processes. In an IoT report, McKinsey notes that the missing
          integration of IoT solutions into existing business workflows is a top
          IoT capability gap.1

          IIoT software vendors may claim their products integrate with business
          systems, but simply passing data to a business system is not the same
          as creating an end-to-end business process. Using that process,
          organizations will have an increased number of smart things in their
          factory, increased levels of automation and more complex supply
          chains. The expectation is to make everything work together
          effectively in a way that is dramatically better than today.
