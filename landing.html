            <span>"</span>The Internet of Things will transform business processes into IoT- enabled business processes, where things and humans collaborate. We will witness an increased autonomy of smart things that will be able to navigate their
            own ways through our factories, distribution centres and supply chains, analysing context- sensitive multiple data points to drive highly individualised business processes.

            <span>"</span>One of the major challenges that companies face when trying to solve for revenue generating IoT solutions is the fact these solutions often require disrupting the same business model that made them successful to date.

            <span>"</span>The disruptive potential
            of IoT resides in its
            ability to turn businesses
            inside-out, transform
            products into services,
            transform services into
            learning architectures
            and make us completely
            rethink what the
            organization of the
            future may look like.
